# Swords at Dawn

A 2d fighting game that focuses on neutral and has no extended combos. Inspiried by Bushido Blade.

Overall goal:

Three avenues of attacks, low, medium high

Dodge in various ways or block, but blocking can cause your sword to break

One hit can end your life

Possible arcade modes including a sleek parry game (a rapid back and forth skill test against a friend)
